Run:\
-Python files can be run as "python3 xxx.py" \
-To run .ipynb files open them in colab. They can be run again. Change paths of data files and score.py file according to the directory structure.\

Description:\
The different files in code correspond to:\
-score.py: Evaluation script\
-simple-baseline.py: Our simple baseline script\
-CSLSTranslation.ipynb: \
-Original_Bert_as_a_service_v2.ipynb: ipynb file used for getting m-bert word embeddings\
-Published_Baseline_Reimplementation.ipynb: our published baseline reimplemented model.\
-Extension_1.ipynb: our first extension (m-BERT) model.\
-Extension_2.ipynb: our second extension (with the best combination) model.\
-Final_Integrated_Model.ipynb: our final integrated model.\

For descriptions of our simple-baseline and our scoring procedures, see simple-baseline.md and scoring.md, respectively.
