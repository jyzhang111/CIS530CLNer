This is a reupload of our team's final submission for our project in CIS530 - Computational Linguistics.

The purpose for this project was to implement and evaluate various cross lingual NER models using bilingual and multilingual word embeddings, so that high resource languages could be used to help develop NER models for a low-to-no resource language.

Individual README files can also be found in the separate folders, for example, the README file in the code folder gives a high level overview for how to rerun our code. The project report and presentation slides can be found as well in the repository.
